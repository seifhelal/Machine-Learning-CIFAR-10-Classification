# Machine-Learning-CIFAR-10-Classification

These are my assignments for Practical Machine Deel Learning Course CS4930 at AUC. I try to classify CIFAR-10 Dataset that contains over 60k images with 10 different classes. The techniques used are: 

1- KNN and Linear Least Square: 

KNN- ACCR of the testing is: 0.324300%

LLS- ACCR of the testing is: 0.363700%

2- Multi-layer Fully Connected Neural Network (NN) classifier using my own implmentation and Keras API.

Own implementation- ACCR of the testing is: 0.6125%

Keras API- ACCR of the testing is: 0.6850%

3-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Res-Net classifier using my own implmentation and Keras API. 

Own implementation- ACCR of the testing is: 0.8286%

Keras API- ACCR of the testing is: 0.9273% 

Note: Some of the codes were adapted from Stanford CS231n Course's tempelates.
