# Machine-Learning-CIFAR-10-Classification

These are my assignments for Practical Machine Deel Learning Course CS4930 at AUC. I try to classify CIFAR-10 Dataset that contains over 60k images with 10 different classes. The techniques used are: 

1- KNN and Least Square

2- Multi-layer FullyConnected Neural Network (NN) classifier using my own implmentation and Keras API.

3-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Res-Net classifier using my own implmentation and Keras API. 


Note: Some of the codes were adapted from Stanford CS231n Course's tempelates.
